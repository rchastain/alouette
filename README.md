# Alouette

UCI chess engine able to play Fischer Random Chess.

The program was started as a programming exercise around *bitboards*.

Since the version 0.1.0, the engine uses an opening book. The book is in the [format described by Kathe Spracklen](https://content.iospress.com/articles/icga-journal/icg6-1-04).

This format has been previously used by Marc-Philippe Huget in his engine [La Dame Blanche](http://www.quarkchess.de/ladameblanche/).

*Alouette* is written for the Free Pascal Compiler by Roland Chastain.
